# Building on Core

Welcome to the Building on Core tutorial repository! This repository is designed to provide developers with ready-to-use boilerplates and comprehensive guidebooks for building various dApps on the Core blockchain.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find a variety of boilerplates tailored for different use cases, along with detailed guidebooks to help you get started with developing, deploying, and managing your dApps on Core.

## Organization

- **[Simple Storage Full Stack Dapp](./01-Simple%20Storage%20Full%20Stack%20Dapp/README.md):** boilerplate for deploying a simple smart contract on the Core blockchain and integrating frontend to read/write data from/to the smart contracts.

- **[Basic Staking Full Stack Dapp](./02-Basic%20Staking%20Full%20Stack%20Dapp/README.md):** a simple staking dapp that uses custom ERC20 tokens for staking and rewarding users. It uses Hardhat for development, Solidity for smart contracts, and React for the frontend.

- **[Decentralized Guestbook](./03-Decentralized%20Guestbook/README.md):** a decentralized guestbook application using Hardhat for development, Solidity for smart contracts, and React for the frontend.

- **[Pyth Pull Oracles](./04-Pyth%20Pull%20Oracles/README.md):** integration example for using Pyth Network oracles to fetch real-time price data on the Core blockchain with smart contracts and frontend integration.

- **[Hello World Dapp](./05-Hello-World-Dapp/README.md):** a beginner-friendly "Hello World" dApp demonstrating basic smart contract deployment and frontend interaction on Core blockchain.

- **[Subgraphs on Core](./06-Subgraphs-on-Core/README.md):** guide for creating and deploying Graph Protocol subgraphs to index blockchain data from Core network with query examples.

- **[NFT Minting dApp on Core](./07-NFT%20Mintng%20dApp%20on%20Core/README.md):** complete NFT minting application with smart contracts for creating and managing non-fungible tokens on Core blockchain.

- **[Guess Game](./08-Guess-Game/README.md):** Guess game allows players to guess a secret number on the Core blockchain. The first player to guess the correct number is rewarded with tokens.

- **[Token Swap Dapp](./09-Token-swap-Dapp/README.md):** Decentralized token swapping application allowing users to exchange different ERC20 tokens on the Core.

- **[Advanced Stake Dapp](./10-Advanced-Stake-Dapp/README.md):** Staking application with advanced features including multiple staking pools, reward calculations, and comprehensive frontend dashboard.

- **[Bridge Token Using Chainlink](./11-Bridge-Token-Using-Chainlink/README.md):** Cross-chain token bridging solution using Chainlink's CCIP (Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) for secure token transfers between blockchains.

- **[Core MultiSig](./12-Core-MultiSig/README.md):** Multi-signature wallet implementation for Core blockchain enabling secure multi-party transaction approvals and asset management.

- **[Core Test Token Faucet](./13-Core-Test-Token-Faucet/README.md):** Testnet token faucet application for distributing test tokens to developers and users on Core testnet networks.

- **[Corelend](./14-Corelend/README.md):** Decentralized lending protocol built on Core blockchain allowing users to borrow and lend digital assets with smart contracts.

- **[DNS Protocol](./15-dns-protocol/README.md):** Decentralized naming service (DNS) protocol on the CORE blockchain, inspired by Ethereum Name Service (ENS). This project lets users register human-readable `.core` domains, map them to on-chain and off-chain resources, and manage ownership through smart contracts.

- **[Pump.Core](./16-Pump.Core/README.md):** MemeLaunch is a dynamic, pump.fun-inspired DApp built on the Core Blockchain, enabling users to **easily launch tokens**, **view all launched tokens**, **buy any token**, and **track token balances** in their wallets. It is **modular**, **extensible**, and ready for builders who want to expand functionality like adding a **creator dashboard**, **liquidity tools**, and more.
