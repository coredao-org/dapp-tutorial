# Building on Core 
Welcome to the Building on Core tutorial repository! This repository is designed to provide developers with ready-to-use boilerplates and comprehensive guidebooks for building various dApps on the Core blockchain.

## Overview
In this repository, you will find a variety of boilerplates tailored for different use cases, along with detailed guidebooks to help you get started with developing, deploying, and managing your dApps on Core. 

## Organization
* **[Simple Storage Full Stack Dapp](./01-Simple%20Storage%20Full%20Stack%20Dapp/README.md):** boilerplate for deploying a simple smart contract on the Core blockchain and integrating frontend to read/write data from/to the smart contracts.

* **[Basic Staking Full Stack Dapp](./02-Basic%20Staking%20Full%20Stack%20Dapp/README.md):** a simple staking dapp that uses custom ERC20 tokens for staking and rewarding users. It uses Hardhat for development, Solidity for smart contracts, and React for the frontend. 

* **[Decentralized Guestbook](./03-Decentralized%20Guestbook/README.md):** a decentralized guestbook application using Hardhat for development, Solidity for smart contracts, and React for the frontend. 
* **[Todo](./11-Todo/README.md):** a decentralized Todo application using the foundry developing the smart contract (Solidity), React for building the dapp.
